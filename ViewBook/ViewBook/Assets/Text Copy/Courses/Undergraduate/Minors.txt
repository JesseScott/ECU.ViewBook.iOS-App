ART + TEXT MINOR

Explore how text operates within contemporary visual art, and develop the use of text within your own practice.  The Art + Text Minor considers alternative structures of distribution including artist’s books and multiples, libraries, online database projects as well as typography as an artistic tool, placing equal focus on concepts and materials by providing contexts and skills for considering and working with text-based art practices. 

CURATORIAL PRACTICES MINOR

Be introduced to the history, theory, and practice of curating within the contemporary visual arts.  Through a combination of research and practice, you will begin to consider historical precedents, modes of theoretical inquiry, and the real world issues that shape the curatorial field. 

SOCIAL PRACTICE AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT MINOR

Social Practice and Community Engagement (SPACE) is an interdisciplinary minor for you to focus on social practice, ecology and sustainability, documentary practices or community projects. You will have the opportunity to engage with real world issues and problems through applied art, media and design.
